# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project applies a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival from the Titanic dataset (from Kaggle). It includes:

- Full preprocessing pipeline (handling missing data, encoding categorical features)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy ~79.88%)
- Visual insights like feature importance, decision scatter plots, and sigmoid function

The notebook serves as a great baseline for binary classification tasks and demonstrates interpretable ML using scikit-learn.
